# Peter's Random Password Generator

## Description

This project was my first attempt at creating page functionality with JavaScript. It is a random password generator, which takes user input including length, and character selections in order for a user to selectively create a customized password. It allows a user to create different passwords for enhanced personal web security.

I learned a great deal about JavaScript because it was incredibly difficult for me at first, but I returned to the basics of JavaScript after a few weeks of exposure during lecture and I was better able to see the patterns and understand the syntax.

## Installation

The application only requires internet access and a browser with a URL input. Then at the click of a button, the window prompts ask a series of questions regarding the user's desired password characteristics. The user clicks 'OK' if they want a character set included, and they click 'Cancel' if they do not. The minimum password length is 8 characters, and the maximum is 128.

## Usage

Simply click the 'Generate password" button to begin the process. Input a desired length, and click 'OK' for any desired character sets to include in the password.
